# Supervised-SalaryPrediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file demonstrating the implementation of AI and Machine Learning techniques for predicting employee salaries. 

## Overview

The project uses a dataset containing employee data, including their years of work experience and corresponding salaries. We implement a Linear Regression model, Decision tree, and Random Forest to predict the salaries based on their work experience and salaries.

## Dataset

The dataset contains three columns which is:
- **Years of Experience**: The number of years the employee has worked.
- **Salary**: The salary corresponding to the years of experience.
